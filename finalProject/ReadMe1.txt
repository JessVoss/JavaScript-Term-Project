This is a fairly easy to understand game.  Each peace gets to be moved in whatever arangement you choose. 
However they lay in specific orders so you do not get to choose what is in front of what.  This game was fairly 
easy to make I didn't have any issues when I made it however, it did give me some issues when I separated the code out.
Meaning I made a separated file for javascript and css files.  I got it worked out.  At this time there is no future 
instalments.
