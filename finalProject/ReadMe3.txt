This was originally set up to be a word puzzle game I changed it as of right now because I like the fact they all center around a them.  The 
directions are fairly easy you move the wolf by clicking the up, down, right, or left on the screen to avoid hitting the logs. The game was 
not horrible to set up.  My biggest issue in the code was changeing the sizes of the wolf puppy and getting log clip art that made sense for 
the game.  I didn't have any issues when I made it however, it did give me some issues when I separated the code out.
Meaning I made a separated file for javascript and css files.  I got it worked out.  At this time there is no future 
instalments.
