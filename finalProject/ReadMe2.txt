This game is a lot like mind sweeper but instead of clicking on the boxes hoping you dont hit a trap. The game itself is a little more
 complicated code and I have to add some things into it so it will work.  I actually had to change from a position site to a grid work
 When I tried to add wolves into the code and made sure it worked it doesnt.  So I had to take it back out.  It functions much like
 the original mind sweeper.  I would like to in the future add a timer.
